10 simulations: TODO (record time using 0m0.000s format)
100 simulations: 0.056s
1000 simulations: 0.034s
10000 simulations: 0.088s
100000 simulations: 0.646s
1000000 simulations: 6.457s

Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
  100 simulations will run the fastest
  1000000 simulations will take the longest

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100
